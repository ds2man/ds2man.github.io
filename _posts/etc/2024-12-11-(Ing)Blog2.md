In the previous post, I explained how to track blog visitors using GA4. However, the blog still doesn't appear in Google or Naver search results. Let me share my blog with you.

## *Google Search Console*

#### *What is Google Search Console?*

**Google Search Console** is a free service by Google that helps website owners track and enhance their site’s visibility in Google Search results. It provides valuable insights such as search traffic, user queries, and the indexing status of your webpages.

In addition, it offers detailed error reports that help you identify and fix **SEO** issues, making it easier to boost your site’s ranking and overall performance in search engines.

#### *Add My Blog to Google Search Console*

- Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console). 
- Click **“Add Property”** in the top-left corner. You’ll see two options:
	- Domain (e.g., `example.com`) - covers all subdomains and protocols.
	- <ins>**URL prefix** (e.g., `https://ds2man.github.io`) - better for GitHub Pages.</ins>
- Verify Ownership
	- Note. Since I previously set up **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and added the GA tracking code to your blog’s  `_includes/head.html` file, Google Search Console could automatically verify your ownership through that existing connection.
- Request Indexing
	- Note. If you publish a new blog post and want it to show up in Google faster:
	  URL Inspection → Click **“Request Indexing”**
- Submit a Sitemap (optional but highly recommended)
	- Note. If your blog doesn’t already have a `sitemap.xml`, you can:
	- Use the [Jekyll Sitemap plugin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap) if you're using Jekyll.
	- Or generate one using tools like [xml-sitemaps.com](https://www.xml-sitemaps.com/).
