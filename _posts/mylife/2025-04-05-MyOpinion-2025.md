## *A Fulfilling First Quarter of 2025*

The first quarter flew by like a whirlwind. At the end of last year, I set new goals for myself, wondering, _"Can I really follow through on all of this?"_ But to cut to the chase, Iâ€™d say Iâ€™m **120% satisfied**. It was the first time Iâ€™ve taken on a challenge like this in my life, and above all, Iâ€™m proud of myself for doing so. I'm deeply grateful to myself for pushing through, and I especially want to thank my wife, who quietly stood by my side throughout.

#### *Starting a Blog*

To be honest, the idea of starting a blog has been on my mind for the past three years. But I kept finding excuses to put it off and never actually got started until this year. I finally took that first step. Once again, I was reminded that **clear motivation is the most powerful force that drives our lives forward**.

I built the blog using GitHub Pages, and from installing Ruby and Jekyll to setting up the environment and generating the blog itself, I went through quite a few bumps along the way. It was hard to find straightforward solutions, even through Googling or ChatGPT. I had to figure things out myself. Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed that process. Looking back, those experiences have become personal assets I truly value.

As of April 5, 2025, Iâ€™ve written **52 posts in just three months**. I only slept around 4 hours a day, but I genuinely enjoyed breaking down what I know and what I donâ€™t. I still have a lot to learn, but I believe Iâ€™ve **laid a solid foundation to increase my own value**.

Planting green grass on GitHubâ€¦ well, that was just a fun bonus. ðŸ˜…

#### *LLM & RAG*

As Iâ€™ve mentioned in previous posts, I believe my future lies in **LLM and RAG**. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been dedicating myself to studying this field lately. The rapid, almost intimidating pace of AI development can feel overwhelming at times, but as long as I stay focused like I am now, I believe Iâ€™ll be able to keep up by the next quarter.

One thing that especially blew my mind recently was **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**. It felt like witnessing another paradigm shift. In this rapidly changing landscape, Iâ€™m reminded how important it is to **stay a lifelong learner**.

Thankfully, a department showed interest in the LLM-related POC I led last year, and I was lucky enough to be asked to lead the development directly. I still have much to learn, but the **confidence** that I can do this comes from the steady effort Iâ€™ve put in so far. Thatâ€™s why I plan to dive even deeper into this area in the second quarter.

#### *No more part leader roles*

It was a bit of a bittersweet decision, but ultimately a good one. While it was a chance to demonstrate leadership, the managerial role at Samsung didnâ€™t quite align with the ideal I had in mind. So I stepped down.

This decision freed up my time and allowed me to **focus on the path I truly want to take**, which made it a very meaningful change.

#### *In Closing*

2025 started off on fire. As I steadily pursued the goals I had set, I learned, grew, and reaffirmed my direction. I still have areas to improve, but I believe the experiences and insights I gained will be a great source of strength moving forward.

I hope this blog becomes more than just a journal. I want it to be a space where I can have honest conversations with myselfâ€”and perhaps, offer a bit of inspiration to someone else. Just as Iâ€™ve been doing, I want to keep learning, practicing, sharing, and growing.

Hereâ€™s to continuing this passion and focus in the next quarter. And to you, reading thisâ€”I genuinely wish you the best as you run your own race with pride and joy.
