In this post, we will explore various methods for querying MilvusDB. For more details, please refer to the [official Milvus website](https://milvus.io/docs/). I will primarily focus on the representative search methods that I have personally used at least once. I'll update this content once I learn more.

<!--
이번 글에서는 MilvusDB를 조회하는 다양한 방법을 습득해보자. [Milvus 공식 사이트](https://milvus.io/docs/)에 자세히 설명되어 있으니 참고하자. 그중 대표적인(내가 한번이라도 사용한) 검색방법 위주로 설명하겠다. 조금 더 많이 배우면 내용을 업데이트 하겠다.

## *Search*

#### *Basic ANN Search*

Based on an index file recording the sorted order of vector embeddings, the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search locates a subset of vector embeddings based on the query vector carried in a received search request, compares the query vector with those in the subgroup, and returns the most similar results. With ANN search, Milvus provides an efficient search experience.
The most representative method is [Single-Vector Search](https://milvus.io/docs/single-vector-search.md).

<!--
벡터 임베딩의 정렬 순서를 기록하는 인덱스 파일을 기반으로, 근사 최근접(ANN) 검색은 받은 검색 요청에 담긴 쿼리 벡터를 기준으로 일부 벡터 임베딩을 찾고, 해당 하위 그룹 내의 벡터와 쿼리 벡터를 비교하여 가장 유사한 결과를 반환합니다. ANN 검색을 통해 Milvus는 효율적인 검색 경험을 제공합니다.
-->

```python
# Connect to MilvusClient
milvusClient = MilvusClient(uri=MILVUS_URL)
milvusClient.using_database(MILVUS_DB_NAME)

# Embed the query.
question = "US Open tennis tournament."
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(f"./{MODEL_FOLDER}/{EMBED_MODEL}")
vector_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])

# Retrieve all field names of the collection.
collection_info = milvusClient.describe_collection(MILVUS_COL_NAME)
fields = [field["name"] for field in collection_info["fields"]]

PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF = 0.6
# Basic ANN Search
vector_res = milvusClient.search(
    collection_name=MILVUS_COL_NAME,
    data=vector_embedding, # 1.Basic ANN Search
    output_fields=fields,
    limit=4,
    # search_params={"metric_type": "COSINE", "params": {"radius": PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF}}, # Note. metric_type and radius
)

for hits in vector_res:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Distance: {hit['distance']}, NewsPaper: {hit['entity']['NewsPaper']}, News: {hit['entity']['News']}")
```

```bash
Distance: 0.6732997894287109, NewsPaper: Yonhap News, News: Jannik Sinner (World No. 1, Italy) clinched the men's singles title at the US Open tennis tournament.
Distance: 0.6732997894287109, NewsPaper: MBC, News: Jannik Sinner (World No. 1, Italy) clinched the men's singles title at the US Open tennis tournament.
Distance: 0.5168114900588989, NewsPaper: Chosun Ilbo, News: Jannik Sinner dominated men's tennis in 2024, securing the ATP Finals title.
Distance: 0.4742506444454193, NewsPaper: Dong-A Ilbo, News: Novak Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz faced off in the men's singles final at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
```

#### *Filtered Search*

An ANN search finds vector embeddings most similar to specified vector embeddings. However, the search results may not always be correct. You can include filtering conditions in a search request so that Milvus conducts metadata filtering before conducting ANN searches, reducing the search scope from the whole collection to only the entities matching the specified filtering conditions. There are two methods: `Standard Filtering` and `iterative filtering`. [Filtered Search](https://milvus.io/docs/filtered-search.md)

![Standard Filtering and iterative filtering](/assets/img/db/2024-11-18-Milvus4_1.png)
_Standard Filtering and iterative filtering_

```python
# Connect to MilvusClient
milvusClient = MilvusClient(uri=MILVUS_URL)
milvusClient.using_database(MILVUS_DB_NAME)

# Embed the query.
question = "US Open tennis tournament."
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(f"./{MODEL_FOLDER}/{EMBED_MODEL}")
vector_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])

# Retrieve all field names of the collection.
collection_info = milvusClient.describe_collection(MILVUS_COL_NAME)
fields = [field["name"] for field in collection_info["fields"]]

# Filtered Search
query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\'"
# query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\' and NewsPaper==\'MBC\'"
vector_res = milvusClient.search(
    collection_name=MILVUS_COL_NAME,
    data=vector_embedding, # 1.Basic ANN Search
    output_fields=fields,
    limit=4,
    filter=query_filter, # 2.Filter Search(Standard Filtering)
    search_params={ "hints": "iterative_filter" } # 2.Filter Search(iteraive filtering)
)

for hits in vector_res:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Distance: {hit['distance']}, Topic: {hit['entity']['Topic']}, NewsPaper: {hit['entity']['NewsPaper']}, News: {hit['entity']['News']}")
```

```bash
Distance: 0.6732997894287109, Topic: US Open Victory, NewsPaper: Yonhap News, News: Jannik Sinner (World No. 1, Italy) clinched the men's singles title at the US Open tennis tournament.
Distance: 0.6732997894287109, Topic: 2024 US Open Victory, NewsPaper: MBC, News: Jannik Sinner (World No. 1, Italy) clinched the men's singles title at the US Open tennis tournament.
Distance: 0.5168114900588989, Topic: ATP Finals Victory, NewsPaper: Chosun Ilbo, News: Jannik Sinner dominated men's tennis in 2024, securing the ATP Finals title.
```

#### *Range Search*

A range search improves search result relevancy by restricting the distance or score of the returned entities within a specific range. This page helps you understand what range search is and the procedures to conduct a range search. [Range Search](https://milvus.io/docs/range-search.md)

![Range Search](/assets/img/db/2024-11-18-Milvus4_2.png)
_Range Search_

```python
# Connect to MilvusClient
milvusClient = MilvusClient(uri=MILVUS_URL)
milvusClient.using_database(MILVUS_DB_NAME)

# Embed the query.
question = "US Open tennis tournament."
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(f"./{MODEL_FOLDER}/{EMBED_MODEL}")
vector_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])

# Retrieve all field names of the collection.
collection_info = milvusClient.describe_collection(MILVUS_COL_NAME)
fields = [field["name"] for field in collection_info["fields"]]

# Range Search
query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\'"
# query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\' and NewsPaper==\'MBC\'"
PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF = 0.6
vector_res = milvusClient.search(
    collection_name=MILVUS_COL_NAME,
    data=vector_embedding, # 1.Basic ANN Search
    output_fields=fields,
    limit=4,
    filter=query_filter, # 2.Filter Search
    search_params={"metric_type": "COSINE", "params": {"radius": PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF}}, # 3.Range Search
)

for hits in vector_res:
    for hit in hits:
        print(f"Distance: {hit['distance']}, Topic: {hit['entity']['Topic']}, NewsPaper: {hit['entity']['NewsPaper']}, News: {hit['entity']['News']}")
```

```bash
Distance: 0.6732997894287109, Topic: US Open Victory, NewsPaper: Yonhap News, News: Jannik Sinner (World No. 1, Italy) clinched the men's singles title at the US Open tennis tournament.

```

## *Delete Entities*

It's very simple. You just need to change the previously learned search to delete. [Delete](https://milvus.io/docs/delete-entities.md#Delete-Entities)

<!--
매우 단순하다. 앞서 배운 search를 delete로 변경해주기만 하면 된다. [Delete](https://milvus.io/docs/delete-entities.md#Delete-Entities)
-->

```python
# Connect to MilvusClient
milvusClient = MilvusClient(uri=MILVUS_URL)
milvusClient.using_database(MILVUS_DB_NAME)

# Embed the query.
question = "US Open tennis tournament."
embedding_model = SentenceTransformer(f"./{MODEL_FOLDER}/{EMBED_MODEL}")
vector_embedding = embedding_model.encode([question])

# Retrieve all field names of the collection.
collection_info = milvusClient.describe_collection(MILVUS_COL_NAME)
fields = [field["name"] for field in collection_info["fields"]]

# Range Search
query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\'"
# query_filter = "Topic like \'%Victory%\' and NewsPaper==\'MBC\'"
PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF = 0.6
vector_res = milvusClient.delete( # search -> delete
    collection_name=MILVUS_COL_NAME,
    data=vector_embedding, # 1.Basic ANN Search
    output_fields=fields,
    limit=4,
    filter=query_filter, # 2.Filter Search
    search_params={"metric_type": "COSINE", "params": {"radius": PROCESSMAP_COSINE_REF}}, # 3.Range Search
)

print(vector_res)
```

```bash
{'delete_count': 3, 'cost': 0}
```
